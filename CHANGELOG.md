## [Unreleased]

### User-facing
- **Backup: guided GitLab connect** — The Backup page's connect card gains a GitHub / GitLab switch. GitLab works with gitlab.com or a self-hosted instance (for teams whose data must stay in-house): paste a personal access token with the `api` scope and a bare project name to auto-create a private project in your personal namespace, or a full path like `group/team/backup` to connect an existing project. The token is stored in the OS keychain keyed by host — the same storage the sync engine already uses — and revoke/reconnect/delete-remote guidance is provider-aware. GitLab has no device-flow sign-in, so the PAT is the guided path; SSH users can keep pasting a remote URL under **Settings → Git Sync Configuration**.

## [1.40.0] - 2026-09-17

### Release Overview
- Adding skills in bulk, a project workspace that counts each skill once, and an end to the disk thrashing the update check caused on macOS.

### User-facing
- **Add skills in bulk** — The Add Skills sheet gains Select all / Deselect all and Shift+click range selection, with a count of what is selected. Setting up a new project meant clicking every skill individually; enabling 10–30 at once is now two clicks. Only skills that are actually addable in the current filtered view are touched. Thanks to @ZhuYichuan (#428).
- **A project workspace now counts each skill once** — A repository that ships several skills was miscounted: the same skill deployed to three agents counted as three, and sync health was tallied per copy rather than per skill. Worse, matching a project copy back to its library skill scored the candidates and took the highest, so a tie was broken arbitrarily — two skills with identical content could bind a copy to the wrong one and show a sync status belonging to another skill. Copies are now grouped before counting, with a group reporting the most severe status it carries, and the match resolves in layers, refusing to guess when a layer leaves more than one candidate. Thanks to @lijianqiang12 (#267, #262).
- **macOS: checking all updates no longer thrashes the disk** — Every acquisition of the central repository lock fsynced its stamp file, which on macOS flushes the whole volume's cache and bills every dirty page in it — including other processes' — to this app. The update check takes that lock once per skill by design, so a library of ~75 skills issued 75 whole-volume barriers per round; one hour of it was reported by the system as 2.1 GB of "file backed memory dirtied", 24x over the disk-writes limit. The stamp exists only to name the operation holding the lock, and mutual exclusion comes from `flock`, never from the file's contents.
- **A non-Chinese interface no longer falls back to Chinese** — Any string without a translation in the selected language showed Simplified Chinese. English is the fallback everywhere now, except Traditional Chinese, which still falls back to Simplified. Thanks to @jonathanleiva15 (#394).
- **Fixed: Shift+clicking a range painted the rows' text in highlight blue**, because the browser extends its own text selection from the previous click. The picker rows are click targets rather than prose, so they now opt out of text selection.

### Developer & Governance
- The Vite dev server no longer watches `src-tauri/target`, where a single `cargo build` produced tens of thousands of file events and stalled hot reload. Thanks to @loeanxi (#397).
- Two defects were found reviewing #267 before release. The new layered match put the central directory name above the content hash, so a library holding both `Code Review` and `code-review` bound the first one's export — written under the slug `code-review` — to the second one's row; since importing a project copy back installs into the matched row's directory, that would have overwritten the other skill. A hash identifying exactly one skill is now consulted right after `source_ref`, while several skills sharing a hash still fall through to the directory and name layers, so #267's own fix is untouched. Separately, a preset with copies on some but not all of a project's agents reported as never applied rather than partially applied.
- The comments #267 added were translated to English, matching the rest of the codebase.
## [1.39.0] - 2026-09-15

### Release Overview
- Preset chips wrap instead of being cut off, and line endings alone no longer make a skill look out of date. Also adds GitLab Duo as a built-in agent, and fixes two bugs that could leave you stuck: a confirmation dialog whose buttons scrolled off screen, and imported skills that permanently reported a missing source.

### User-facing
- **Preset chips now wrap instead of being cut off** — With more than about nine presets the row overflowed the window and the ones past the edge could not be reached with a mouse at all. They now wrap onto as many lines as they need, so every preset stays visible and clickable. Thanks to @ZhuYichuan (#447, #341).
- **Skills no longer sit at "update available" forever on a Windows + macOS pair** — A skill imported from a local folder is compared against that folder byte for byte, and Git for Windows converts line endings on checkout by default. The same skill is therefore CRLF on one machine and LF on the other, the comparison never matched, and re-importing only rewrote the library in the local encoding — so the two machines pushed the same skill back and forth, each seeing an update the other had just "made". Line endings alone no longer count as a difference. Everything else still does: a file the comparison cannot read, a directory it cannot enter, and content that is not valid UTF-8 all keep their byte-exact treatment rather than being assumed to match, and the stored identity of a skill is unchanged. Thanks to @WingSky2022 (#440).
- **GitLab Duo is now a built-in agent** (54 supported out of the box). It deploys to `~/.gitlab/duo/skills` and also discovers skills in the shared `~/.agents/skills` root. **On Windows, set the skills directory manually**: GitLab Duo reads `%APPDATA%\GitLab\duo\skills`, which this release does not detect automatically, so Duo will otherwise show as not installed. (#433)
- **Fixed: the update confirmation dialog could not be dismissed when it listed many files.** Updating a skill whose new version drops a lot of files grew the dialog past the top and bottom of the window, with no scrollbar and both buttons off screen. The dialog now caps its height and scrolls the file list instead, at every text size. (#430)
- **Fixed: an imported skill could permanently report "source missing" after its source directory was adopted.** When the agent directory a skill was imported from got turned into a managed deployment, removing that deployment orphaned the skill's source — update checks then failed forever even though the central copy was intact. The source is now re-pointed at the central copy before the replacement happens. A skill whose source is reached through a symlink is left alone, since the symlink is only unlinked and the real folder survives. (#425)

### Developer & Governance
- The byte hash `hash_entries` is untouched and remains every skill's stored identity. The line-ending comparison is a separate, stricter function consulted only when two byte hashes already disagree, so no stored hash is invalidated and no migration is needed.
- `npm run release:prepare` now syncs `package-lock.json` alongside `package.json`. Its version field had been stale at 1.22.1 while the app was at 1.38.0, so every contributor's `npm install` produced a stray diff.
- Corrected the GitLab Duo adapter's path comment, which described the Windows location correctly and then claimed the Unix path applied everywhere but the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` / `GLAB_CONFIG_DIR` cases — omitting Windows itself.
## [1.38.0] - 2026-09-08

### Release Overview
- Installing one skill out of a large repository now downloads that skill, not the repository.

### User-facing
- Installing or updating a skill whose source names one skill directory now fetches only that directory, using a partial clone and a sparse checkout. Installing `mcp-builder` out of `anthropics/skills` went from 15 MB to 472 KB of cache on disk. Skills from the same repository share one cache, so the second one costs only its own files. Anything that can go wrong here — a server that refuses partial clones, a git too old to read the arguments the way we mean them, a subdirectory upstream has since moved, a source that names a folder of skills rather than one skill — falls back to the full checkout, so this can only make an install faster, never make it fail.
- A configured proxy no longer defeats the repository cache. The cache refresh passed the proxy setting to `git fetch` in a position git rejects outright, so for proxy users the refresh failed every time and every install and update re-cloned the whole repository from scratch. A proxy changed after a repository was first cached is now picked up too.
- Cancelling an install no longer throws away a healthy repository cache, which used to make the next install download everything again.
- The repository cache is now bounded. Nothing ever deleted an entry before, so it grew by one checkout per repository forever — 569 MB across 48 repositories on an ordinary machine, the oldest untouched for four months. Above 1 GB the least recently used repositories are dropped; they are re-downloaded only if that skill is installed or updated again. A repository another install is working on is skipped, never deleted underneath it.

### Developer & Governance
- `clone_repo_ref_scoped` is the single clone entry point; the narrow path is taken only when the caller names one skill directory. Preview with no subpath, skills.sh locator installs, `resolve_skill_dir`'s repo-wide fallback and any container subpath all still get a whole tree from a separate cache slot, so the flows that search a repository are untouched.
- The narrow guard requires the subpath to be a skill, not merely to contain one. A container would otherwise pass while leaving `resolve_skill_dir`'s locator search on a one-directory tree, where it does not fail cleanly — it can resolve a different skill that happens to be in scope.
- A narrow checkout is materialized by copying the cache, not by `git clone --local`: cloning from a partial clone makes the source serve objects it does not have and aborts with "could not fetch <oid> from promisor remote".
- `sparse-checkout set` succeeds on a path the repository does not have, simply leaving it absent, so the result is inspected for an actual skill before it is used. Subpaths are never tidied up before being handed to git: on unix a trailing space or a backslash is a legal part of a directory name, so rewriting one would narrow to a neighbour and pass the guard while the caller read a path the checkout lacks.
- The cache-side `sparse-checkout`, `checkout` and `reset --hard` all fetch blobs over the network in a partial clone, so they carry the clone's timeout, cancel flag and current proxy.
- An install checkout is detached from its promisor remote before it leaves this module, so it is not a partial clone. This is what keeps the narrow clone from taxing every future change: callers run plain `git` against the checkout, and without the detach any command reaching an unfetched object would silently become a network round trip that can hang. Detached, a missing object is an immediate error — exactly as in the shallow full checkout that came before. The precise claim is that nothing fetches behind a caller's back; an explicit `fetch` or `pull` against origin would still use the network, and no caller does that. Three settings can register a promisor remote, so all three are cleared, and one of the tests asserts the outcome over a real `file://` partial clone rather than the names of the settings.

## [1.37.1] - 2026-09-07

### Release Overview
- Toolbar fixes in the library, the global and lobster workspaces, and project pages: multi-select moves into the main toolbar, and the library toolbar stops breaking its own labels apart at narrow widths.

### User-facing
- The library toolbar no longer wraps its filter labels mid-word. Below roughly 1100px of toolbar width the segmented buttons collapsed to one character per line and the search field was squeezed from 280px down to 65px. Entering select mode made it visible rather than causing it: the longer "Cancel selection" label pushed an already borderline row over the edge. Segmented labels now stay on one line on every page, and the number of toolbar rows no longer changes when you toggle select mode.
- Multi-select now shares the right-hand toolbar border with the backup, update, refresh and view controls, the same way in the library, the global and lobster workspaces, and project pages. A divider separates the view controls from selection mode, while the labelled selection button keeps its independent active state.

### Developer & Governance
- `.app-segmented-button` carries `whitespace-nowrap`, so a segmented label can no longer break on any page. `ProjectDetail` and `WorkspaceView` already pinned their segmented controls with `shrink-0`; `MySkills` was the only view missing it.

## [1.37.0] - 2026-09-06

### Release Overview
- Batch operations reworked: bulk sync to agents, bulk removal in the global and lobster workspaces, and two selection defects that made the buttons act on more than they said.

### User-facing
- Selecting skills and then changing a filter no longer leaves an invisible selection behind. Selecting ten skills, switching to another tag and pressing delete used to act on the nine that had scrolled out of the filter. The selection is now trimmed to what is on screen when the filter changes, and cleared when you switch project or agent.
- The enable/disable button now counts what it will actually change. With 23 of 30 selected skills already enabled, it said "Enable 30" and then reported "7 enabled".
- New: sync a batch of skills to one or more agents from the library, instead of opening each skill's detail panel. The dialog shows how many of the selection each agent already has, and only adds the missing ones.
- New: select mode in the global and lobster workspaces, which had none. "Remove" is kept as two separate buttons there, because it means two different things: unsyncing a managed skill leaves the central copy intact, while deleting a local-only skill cannot be undone. Both confirmations list the affected skills by name.
- Bulk tag edits and enable/disable now show progress and cannot be triggered twice by accident.
- The toolbar keeps update and delete in the "…" menu, so the buttons on screen are the ones you reach for; delete no longer carries the same visual weight as an everyday action.
- The select-mode entry moved out of the grid/list switcher, where it read as a third view, and now has a label.
- Escape leaves select mode, and also closes the confirmation, tag and sync dialogs, which previously ignored it.
- Editing tags from a project now says that tags live in the central library and reach every project using those skills.
- Toolbar controls line up: search field, segmented controls and buttons were 36, 38, 40 and 42px tall next to each other, and are now all 40px. The Add Skill button also picks up the app's standard primary-button colouring.

### Developer & Governance
- `MultiSelectToolbar` takes an action list with three tones instead of twenty business-specific props, which is what makes the overflow menu and the workspace's two removal semantics expressible without a fourth variant.
- `useMultiSelect` adjusts the selection during render rather than in an effect, per React's guidance and eslint's `react-hooks` rules, and derives the live selection from the current items so a deleted key cannot re-select a later item that reuses its path.
- Toolbar sizing moved into `.app-toolbar-segmented` / `.app-toolbar-button` component classes; the sky, violet, amber and red-600 literals in the bulk toolbar and `CardActionMenu` were replaced with the repo's own tokens.
- A set of workspace i18n keys that had been unreferenced since an earlier refactor is in use again for the bulk removal flow.
## [1.36.2] - 2026-09-05

### Release Overview
- Two git source fixes: a skill pinned to a tag no longer fails its update check forever, and skills hosted on a private repository work in the desktop app.

### User-facing
- A skill installed from a tag (`.../tree/v1.2.3/...`) no longer shows a permanent "check failed" badge. Installation always accepted a tag, but the update check looked for a branch of that name and never found one, so the failure could not be cleared by retrying.
- Skills on a private repository can now be checked and installed from the desktop app. They previously failed with libgit2's own wording — "remote authentication required but no callback set" — while the same skills worked from the CLI, because the app never handed git a way to obtain credentials. Credentials now come from the app's keychain entry, your git credential helper (osxkeychain, Git Credential Manager, libsecret), or ssh-agent.
- When no credentials are available, the message says which host needs a sign-in instead of quoting a libgit2 error code.
- A tag source no longer re-downloads its repository on every update check.
- The skill detail panel labelled the source ref "Branch" even when it held a tag; it now reads "Branch / Tag".

### Developer & Governance
- Both revision resolvers match refs by exact name across `refs/heads` and `refs/tags`, preferring a branch, then an annotated tag's peeled commit, then the tag object. Taking the first line of `ls-remote` output would have adopted an annotated tag's object sha and reported an update on every check.
- Tree-URL disambiguation lists tags as well as heads, matched in a second pass so a tag cannot claim a URL a branch explains.
- The git2 clone fallback can check out a tag: it inits an empty repository and shallow-fetches the tag ref, rather than cloning the default branch first.
- All three git2 network entry points in `git_fetcher` install credentials, not just the one the bug report named — the two clone paths meant a private source could be diagnosed but not installed. The keychain is read from inside the callback, so a public source no longer touches it at all.
- The backup engine (`git2_engine`) is deliberately untouched; it has its own credentials path already in production.
- New tests cover ref ordering, annotated vs lightweight tags, branch-beats-tag disambiguation, and the credentials callback. Three network-dependent tests are ignored by default; one of them empties PATH to exercise the fallback on a machine with no git.
## [1.36.1] - 2026-09-03

### Release Overview
- Applying a preset in a project reaches every agent you have enabled, and the Windows installer no longer flashes a console window on the first launch after an install.

### User-facing
- **A project preset now reaches all of your agents** — Applying a preset inside a project only ever deployed to Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and GitHub Copilot, and to at most three of them. Every other agent — Pi, ZCode, DeepSeek Harness, Kimi, and the rest — was dropped without a word, which is why disabling Claude Code and Codex made the others start working. Priority now only decides the order; every installed and enabled agent is included. Thanks to @ZhuYichuan for the diagnosis and the fix (#400, #403).
- **A stale hidden preference no longer narrows that list** — An older version had a "save default agents" button whose setting outlived the button. If you ever used it, your projects kept deploying to that frozen subset, with nothing in the interface to show it or change it — so the fix above would not have reached you. That leftover setting is now removed on upgrade.
- **The preset bar waits for your real agent list** — Opening a project and clicking a preset before its agent list finished loading could deploy to Claude Code alone. The bar now appears once the real list has arrived.
- **No more console window flashing on Windows** — The helper that publishes the bundled command-line tool ran without hiding its window, so a black console appeared and vanished on the first launch after every install (#413).

### Developer & Governance
- `cli_bridge` routes its `--version` verification through a constructor that sets `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`, the flag every other spawn in the crate already used. It is named so a future spawn here has somewhere obvious to go.
- Migration v7→v8 deletes the orphaned `project_default_export_agents` row. It tolerates a database with no settings table rather than failing an upgrade over a cleanup, and is covered by a test verified to fail when the delete is removed.
- `getDefaultExportAgents` is now a pure function of the project's agent targets, and `presetBarAgentKeys` holds the bar back until those targets have actually loaded rather than deriving from the claude_code-only stand-in.
- A batching change to preset application was reverted before release: cross-vendor review found it misreported per-agent outcomes, since only the backend's validation pass is all-or-nothing while its write loop is not.
## [1.36.0] - 2026-08-29

### Release Overview
- Your coding agents can now drive Skills Manager themselves — installing, updating and deploying skills on your behalf, through the same library and sync engine the app uses.

### User-facing
- **Let your agents manage skills** — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and the rest can now install a skill, deploy it to another agent, or report what is where, by driving Skills Manager rather than writing into an agent's folder behind its back. Sources, preset membership, update tracking and per-agent deployment state all stay intact. The Dashboard offers a one-time setup: pick which agents should be able to do it, and the app installs the `manage-skills` skill and deploys it to exactly those. Nothing is pre-selected, and the prompt disappears for good once you have acted on it or dismissed it — afterwards it is an ordinary library skill, managed from the agent badges on its own card.
- **The CLI is where agents can find it** — The command-line tool has always shipped inside the desktop app, but on macOS it sat inside the `.app` and on Windows inside the install directory, where nothing could reach it. The app now keeps a copy at `~/.skills-manager/bin/`, refreshed on every launch, so agents can use it without anything being added to your PATH. On Linux the `.deb` and `.rpm` already placed it on PATH and still do.
- **A refused deployment now says which directory is in the way** — When a deploy would overwrite something Skills Manager does not own, it refuses and leaves your content untouched. Until now the reason arrived as one long sentence, so an agent asked to do the deployment could only read it back to you. It now carries the actual path, which means your agent can name the directory, confirm nothing in it was deleted, and offer to import it into the library or move it aside.

### Developer & Governance
- New `core/cli_bridge.rs` publishes the bundled CLI to `~/.skills-manager/bin/` off the main thread at startup. A copy rather than a symlink: an AppImage is mounted at a temporary path, Windows reserves symlink creation for administrators, and a relocated `.app` would leave a dangling link. The location is the home directory rather than `central_repo::base_dir()`, which the user can move.
- A `.version` stamp is written last and removed first, and gates the copy: a stale bridge can be a binary that predates the #363 fix and so deletes user directories a current one refuses to touch, which the database's own `user_version` gate cannot catch because such a fix carries no migration. Invalidation has three fallbacks — unlink, truncate, remove the binary itself — so a locked or read-only stamp on Windows cannot leave the pair vouching for itself; when none can take effect the publish is abandoned rather than run with a stamp that lies. The copy is verified by running `--version` with whole-token equality before it is published.
- `AppError` gains an optional `details`, omitted from the wire format when absent, and an `ErrorKind::TargetConflict` that the CLI emits as a `TARGET_CONFLICT` envelope carrying `conflicts[].path`. Only an ownership refusal is classified that way: two library skills planning onto one path stays `InvalidInput`, and a target that cannot be inspected is `Io`, since telling a caller to adopt or move content that may not exist is worse than no advice. The refusal wording now has a single definition so the sentence and the structured form cannot drift.
- The bundled `manage-skills` skill resolves the CLI before anything else, preferring the published copy over whatever is on PATH — a hand-installed binary is often several releases behind while writing the same database. Resolution yields a path to substitute into later commands rather than a shell variable, because each command an agent runs is a new process. An unstamped binary, or a stamp with no binary, stops the skill rather than sending it looking for something that may be older still.
- Both READMEs now carry the skills.sh badge and the `npx skills add` line, so the skill has an entry point for people who never open the app.

## [1.35.1] - 2026-08-28

### Release Overview
- In a project with two agents, an edit made under the second one could not reach the Skills Center, and following the status the app then showed would overwrite that edit. Fixed, together with the cases where no push is safe at all.

### User-facing
- **An edit under any agent now reaches the center** (#327) — A project skill exists once per agent directory and the card aggregates them. The card lit "update to center" if *any* copy was edited, but pushed the copy whose agent name sorted first. Editing under Codex while Claude Code was also configured therefore pushed the untouched Claude copy: the toast said success, nothing of the edit arrived, and the freshly written center then read as newer — so following the card to "update to project" destroyed the edit. The copy that actually carries the edit is pushed now, and the others are realigned from the center afterwards so the card settles instead of flipping. Thanks to @enshulv. Fixes #322.
- **When no copy can be shown to be safe, nothing is written** — If more than one copy of a skill is anything other than in sync with the center, the update is refused and the conflict is named, rather than picking one and silently stranding the rest. Only "in sync" proves a copy holds nothing of its own: it is a content match, while "center is newer" is decided by timestamp *after* the contents already differed, so such a copy can hold work that a pull would destroy. **This is stricter than before**: two agents each holding their own not-yet-imported copy of the same skill now have to be reconciled into one before the center will accept it.

### Developer & Governance
- `classify_sync_status` returns `center_newer` only after the content hashes differ, then picks a side by mtime — it is not proof that the project copy is redundant. The realign step treated it as proof, and the refusal threshold was drawn at "edited" rather than "not provably clean"; both let a copy holding unique content be overwritten by a later action the card itself offered.
- Pushing rebuilds the center directory, moving its mtime to now, which is what turned every stranded copy into `center_newer` — a status whose only remaining card action overwrites all variants, and which the backend's guard does not refuse (it refuses `project_newer` only). That chain, not the push itself, was the data-loss path.
- Sibling realignment runs serially. Two agents' skills roots can be symlinks onto one directory, and each realign rebuilds its target, so concurrent calls on one path failed for no real reason and the batch counted it as a failure.
- Three rounds of cross-vendor review; the substantive defects stopped appearing after the second. Widening the refusal made the bookkeeping it was working around unreachable, so the change ends 38 lines shorter than its first draft.
- Known and unfixed: if two agents' skills roots are symlinks onto one directory, one physical skill scans as two edited copies and the refusal cannot be resolved by editing files. Collapsing roots by canonical path is a scanner change, deliberately not made here.
- These are frontend-only changes and the repo has no frontend test runner, so `test.yml` does not cover them. Verification was `lint`, `build`, and review.

## [1.35.0] - 2026-08-27

### Release Overview
- ZCode joins the supported agents, Linux ARM64 gets its own packages, and a fresh install now opens in the language your system is set to instead of always Simplified Chinese.
- Kimi Code is repointed at the directories it actually reads. Skills synced to Kimi were being written where Kimi never looks — **after upgrading, sync Kimi once more**.

### User-facing
- **ZCode is supported out of the box** (#370) — User-level skills sync to `~/.zcode/skills/` and project-level skills to `<repo>/.zcode/skills`, the same symmetric layout as Claude Code. Plugin skills under `~/.zcode/cli/plugins/` are deliberately not scanned, matching the Claude Code plugin-marketplace policy. That brings the built-in agent count to 53. Thanks to @brofea, who also supplied the official mark from z.ai rather than a redrawn one. Closes #243, #319.
- **Kimi Code skills land where Kimi reads them** (#270) — The adapter deployed to `~/.config/agents/skills` and looked for `~/.kimi` to decide Kimi was installed. Those are the *old kimi-cli*'s locations; kimi-code is a separate generation that reads `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/skills/` (default `~/.kimi-code/skills/`) and `<project>/.kimi-code/skills/`. So a sync reported success while Kimi saw nothing, and an installed Kimi was shown as missing. Both are fixed. **Upgrading rewrites the paths but does not move files**: skills already copied to `~/.config/agents/skills` stay there — that directory is still Amp's and Replit's — so Kimi needs one more sync for its skills to arrive. Thanks to @Libeny.
- **A fresh install opens in your system's language** (#374) — The first-run language was hardcoded to Simplified Chinese, so anyone who does not read it had to find 设置 → 语言 in a UI they could not navigate. The first launch now reads `navigator.languages` and picks the first locale the app can serve, falling back to English. An explicit script beats the region, so `zh-Hans-HK` stays Simplified. An existing choice is never touched — this runs only when neither the saved setting nor localStorage has one. Thanks to @sammcj.
- **Linux ARM64 has its own packages** (#351) — Releases shipped Linux x86_64, macOS ARM64 and Windows x64; an ARM64 Linux machine had nothing it could run, and the macOS ARM64 assets are Mach-O binaries that will not help. `.deb` and `.rpm` are now built natively on an ARM64 runner. Thanks to @superwjfeng.

### Developer & Governance
- Retargeting one tool no longer deletes a directory another tool is still deployed to. Adapters can share a skills directory — Amp and Replit both use `~/.config/agents/skills`, and Kimi did until this release — and the stale-target cleanup removed the path outright without checking who else was pointing at it. Introduced by the Kimi move and caught before release by a cross-vendor review; the regression test fails without the guard.
- `detectLanguage` matches the primary subtag rather than a bare prefix. `startsWith("zh")` also matched `zha` (Zhuang) and `startsWith("en")` matched `enm` (Middle English), consuming the tag and discarding the next entry in the list, which is the one the user actually prefers.
- Three ZCode pull requests were open at once (#338, #370, #390), none of them answered before the next arrived. #370 was taken for using z.ai's own mark; the other two are closed as superseded with the reason stated. The README count and the path-contract test came from #390's work.

## [1.34.2] - 2026-08-16

### Release Overview
- A project copy you had just edited could be reported as the older side, and acting on that reading overwrote your edit. Both sides of the comparison now come from the files themselves.

### User-facing
- **Project sync status no longer judges the library by the wrong clock** — Freshness was decided by comparing the project copy's file timestamp against a database column that records when the library's row was written. Editing files in the library does not move that column, and a metadata-only write moves it while nothing changed, so a project copy you had just edited could be shown as "center is newer". Following that status and pulling from the center then replaced your edit. Both sides are now read from the files.
- **The refusal that protects a newer local copy is more reliable** — "Pull from center" for an agent workspace declines when the local copy is ahead, and that check reads the same comparison, so a library whose row merely looked recent could defeat it.

### Developer & Governance
- `classify_sync_status` walks the center once and answers both the live-hash comparison and its newest content mtime from that walk — replacing one walk plus a database read, so there is no new cost and no cache needed to avoid one.
- Diagnosis is from PR #328, which found it while building a much larger change. Only this part is taken: that PR also snapshots before overwriting and resolves conflicts newest-wins, both of which this project deliberately dropped — 1.34.0 answers the same moment by stopping and asking instead.
- Two existing tests passed only because of the bug, each fabricating an `updated_at` old enough to stand in for age. They now build that age on disk and assert the database column cannot flip the answer. Reverse-verified in both directions.
## [1.34.1] - 2026-08-16

### Release Overview
- Fixes a regression in 1.34.0: if you had already added DeepSeek Harness as a custom agent by hand, its skills paths became impossible to change.

### User-facing
- **A custom agent shadowed by a new built-in can have its paths edited again** (#378) — A custom agent's key is derived from its display name, so an agent added as "DeepSeek Harness" was stored under `deepseek_harness` — the same key 1.34.0 shipped as a built-in. From then on the built-in was what the app resolved and displayed, while path edits were written to the hidden custom definition: the save reported success and the path never moved. Both paths are editable again, and no cleanup is needed. The same would have happened to anyone whose hand-added agent shared a key with any future built-in.

### Developer & Governance
- `find_adapter_with_store` resolves a built-in ahead of a custom tool of the same key, but both path writers checked custom tools first and stored the edit where nothing reads it. Both now consult built-ins first; a genuine custom agent still keeps its paths on its own definition.
- The store side of each command is split into `apply_tool_skills_dir` and `apply_tool_project_skills_dir` so the writes can be exercised against a real store — the commands are async and take Tauri `State`, which is why neither had a test.
- 3 regression tests, reverse-verified: restoring the old precedence in either writer fails its test while the genuine-custom-agent case keeps passing.
## [1.34.0] - 2026-08-16

### Release Overview
- An update can no longer quietly take away files that live inside a skill's folder. When the new version does not have paths that exist now, the update stops and names them instead of applying.

### User-facing
- **An update that would remove files now stops and says which ones** (#256) — Updating replaces a skill's folder wholesale, so anything written inside it that the new version does not have was destroyed without warning. The reporter lost the PowerPoint templates `ppt-master` had generated into its own `templates/`, and only found out afterwards. Every update now first works out which paths exist today and are simply absent from the new version. If any are, nothing is applied: the desktop app lists them and lets you decide, and the skill stays exactly as it was until you do.
- **Unattended updates never make that decision for you** — The startup batch, the background scheduler and the CLI hold the skill back rather than proceed. Its update badge stays, so nothing is lost or hidden; you see the paths when you update it yourself. The CLI reports them as `held_back_removals`.
- **Deployed copies are covered, not just the library** — An agent you deploy to in copy mode gets its folder rebuilt on every sync, so files written into that copy were at the same risk. Each reported path says where it lives, so you know which directory to rescue it from.
- **Re-importing a local skill and re-pointing its source are guarded the same way** — Both replace the whole folder, and the batch button calls the first one "update" as well.
- **Known limit, worth stating plainly**: this compares paths, not contents. A file you edited that the new version also ships keeps its path, so it reads as surviving and your edits are still overwritten silently. Keep local modifications outside the skill folder, or back the library up before updating.
- **DeepSeek Harness is supported** — Deploys to `~/.dsh/skills`. 52 agents out of the box.
- **Git backup no longer tracks compiled Python artifacts** — A skill that runs Python scripts filled the backup repository with `__pycache__/` and `.pyc` files that change on every run. They are now ignored and untracked from existing backups.

### Developer & Governance
- `core/removals.rs` answers one question — which paths exist under the current tree and not under the replacement — and nothing else. It compares by path, since a file whose contents change still exists afterwards and listing it would bury the ones that do not; rolls a wholly-absent directory up to a single entry, so a nested `.git` cannot bury the dialog under thousands of object files; treats a file/directory/symlink shape change as a removal; and returns an error rather than guessing when a path can be neither confirmed present nor confirmed absent, because a wrong "nothing will be lost" is the exact failure it exists to prevent.
- The comparison runs against the staged tree that actually lands, not the raw clone: `installer::copy_skill_dir` drops `.git` and every symlink, so comparing against the clone produced real false negatives.
- Approving is bound to a SHA-256 over the revision and the exact sorted set of paths. The confirming call re-clones, re-stages and recomputes; a set that no longer matches asks again rather than acting on a stale answer. Re-import and relink bind to their own domains.
- `StagedPathGuard` removes a declined skill's staged directory on drop, and is released only after the swap has succeeded, so a failure between the two cannot leave a `.staged-<uuid>` directory behind for the metadata rebuild to adopt as a new skill.
- Audit logs record a held-back update as such instead of as a successful no-op.
- The `manage-skills` skill documents the held-back shape, including that `held_back_removals` is omitted when empty and that no CLI flag accepts it — the field's own doc comment had pointed at a `--force` that `skills update` does not have.
- DeepSeek Harness paths were read out of `packages/util/home-paths` and `packages/skill/skill-filesystem` rather than taken from its README; its shared `~/.agents/skills` root is registered for discovery only, as with Codex and Copilot.
- 453 tests pass.
## [1.33.1] - 2026-08-12

### Release Overview
- Security fix: a crafted git URL could make an install copy a directory from outside the cloned repository into your library. Update if you install skills from links other people share.

### User-facing
- **Installing from a git URL can no longer reach outside the repository** — The path part of a `…/tree/<branch>/<path>` URL was joined onto the clone without checking that it stayed inside it, so a URL whose path climbed far enough resolved to an arbitrary directory on your machine, which was then copied into the library and reported as a successful install. Because the library can be backed up to a git remote, content pulled in this way could also leave the machine. The same applies to a skills.sh shorthand whose `@` part contains a path. Both are now refused. This affected the desktop app and the CLI equally.
- **A git URL pointing at a directory that does not exist is now an error** — It used to fall back to searching the whole repository, which for a repository that groups its skills installed the entire `skills/` container as a single entry. Installing `…/tree/main/artifacts-builder` from a repo whose real path is `skills/web-artifacts-builder` now says so instead of quietly installing 17 unrelated skills as one.
- **Updates no longer substitute a different directory when a skill moves upstream** — If a skills.sh skill's recorded path was taken over by a container or an unrelated directory, an update copied that over your installed skill. The recorded path is now used only when it still holds a skill; otherwise the skill is looked up at its new home, as it already was when the path disappeared entirely.

### Developer & Governance
- `resolve_skill_dir` validates both the requested subpath and the directory finally resolved by `find_skill_dir` with `path_guard::is_path_safe`, covering the locator route as well: `parse_skillssh_shorthand` does not constrain the part after `@` to a single path segment, and `find_skill_dir` joins that id onto the checkout in three places.
- 10 regression tests: `..`, absolute-path and symlink escapes with and without a locator; a missing path with no locator; locator recovery after an upstream move; a locator finding nothing (preserving the #278 assertions); and container enumeration for the preview/confirm install flow.
## [1.33.0] - 2026-08-12

### Release Overview
- A skill you wrote locally and later published to git can now be pointed at that repository without being reinstalled, so it starts receiving updates while keeping its tags, presets and deployments.

### User-facing
- **`skills set-source` re-points an installed skill at a git source in place** — Converting a local skill to a git-backed one previously had no safe path: `install` allocates `<name>-2` and leaves you with a duplicate, `remove` + `install` drops the skill id and with it the tags, preset membership and per-agent deployments, and the desktop app's relink is local-to-local only. The new command updates the skill in place, so everything keyed to its id survives and `update` works from then on.
- **The re-point refuses to guess** — A `--subpath` that does not exist, is not a skill directory, or resolves outside the checkout is an error, never a silent fallback to scanning the whole repository. `--dry-run` reports what would change without needing `--force`, and content that differs from the library copy is only overwritten with `--force`.

### Developer & Governance
- `set_git_source_internal` reuses `update_skill_after_reinstall`, so the row is updated by id. The clone runs outside the repo lock and the row is re-read after locking, refusing to apply a decision made against a stale snapshot; identical content skips file work entirely rather than rewriting the central copy for a metadata-only change.
- Strict subpath resolution is guarded by `path_guard::is_path_safe`, covering absolute paths, `..` traversal and symlinks escaping the checkout, with 7 unit tests.
- CI: publishing a release now triggers a rebuild of skillsmanager.dev.
- Documentation: `skills set-source` in both READMEs; demo screenshots refreshed for the 1.32 UI.
## [1.32.0] - 2026-08-11

### Release Overview
- Deploying a skill can no longer delete a directory Skills Manager did not create. Every write to an Agent directory now has to prove the target is ours before replacing it, and anything it cannot vouch for is left untouched and reported.

### User-facing
- **Deployment refuses to overwrite content that is not ours (#363)** — A skill whose name collides with a directory you created yourself was silently deleted, and the operation reported success. Deployment now replaces only an absent target, a link already pointing at the skill, or a deployment the app has a record of. Anything else is left byte-for-byte intact and the reason is shown. Adopt the existing directory into the library, or move it aside, to continue.
- **`skills export --dest` no longer wipes the destination** — Exporting to a path that already existed deleted it recursively; `--dest ~/Documents` left nothing but a `SKILL.md`. A non-empty destination is now refused, with `--force` to overwrite deliberately.
- **Turning a skill off keeps content that replaced it** — Undeploy, preset switching, and the Agent toggle deleted whatever the app's records pointed at. If you had replaced a managed skill with your own directory, that directory is now preserved and reported instead of deleted.
- **Failures explain themselves** — Adding skills from the library, or applying a preset, used to report only "N skills failed". The affected path, the reason, and what to do about it now appear in the message.
- **Switching an already-deployed skill from symlink to copy mode works** — It previously failed every time with a spurious "infinite recursion" error.

### Developer & Governance
- `sync_engine::sync_skill` takes an explicit `ReplacePolicy` (`NoClobber` / `Recorded { mode }` / `UserConfirmed`), so all nine call sites must state what they are authorized to destroy. Removal is type-specific, closing the window where an object swapped in after the check could be recursively deleted.
- Batch deployment preflights every pair before writing anything and pools ownership evidence per target path, so Agents sharing one skills directory deploy correctly while contradictory records refuse.
- Ownership refusals are reported rather than thrown from `sync_desired_targets`; startup logs them and cannot be blocked from launching by a collision, while explicit user actions surface them as errors.
- 17 regression tests covering the authorization table, startup behavior, shared skills directories, contradictory records, and preservation on undeploy.
- Documentation: link the official site at skillsmanager.dev, and correct the supported agent count to 51.
## [1.31.0] - 2026-08-09

### Release Overview
- Skills Manager now ships an agent-ready CLI that can manage the shared library, real per-agent deployments, presets, tags, and Agent availability without driving the desktop UI.

### User-facing
- **Claude Code, Codex, and other agents can manage Skills Manager directly** — The CLI can list and filter skills, inspect deployment status, deploy or undeploy one or several skills, enable or disable Agents, and create, edit, delete, inspect, deploy, or undeploy presets. Tag operations now include set, rename, and guarded deletion.
- **Preset deployment is additive** — Several presets can be deployed at the same time. Creating a preset or changing its members only organizes the library; it never changes Agent files implicitly. `presets undeploy` without an Agent removes the preset everywhere it actually has target records, including disabled, uninstalled, or no-longer-registered custom Agents.
- **Automation has safer, machine-readable behavior** — `--json` returns stable error codes, bulk destructive operations support `--dry-run`, preset membership updates are atomic, and deployment commands verify the resulting database rows and filesystem state before reporting success. Successful pairs in a partially failed batch are still recorded accurately.
- **Standalone CLI downloads join every release** — Release assets now include `skills-manager-cli` binaries for macOS arm64/x64, Windows x64, and Linux x64. The macOS binaries are Developer ID signed with the hardened runtime and accepted by Apple's notarization service.

### Developer & Governance
- Preset CRUD and membership, tag mutation, and Agent toggles now expose shared internal implementations used by both Tauri commands and the CLI. The desktop app keeps its existing active-preset transitions while CLI organization commands remain side-effect-free.
- Deployment selection and verification use actual `skill_targets` rows when removing files, so stale deployments remain discoverable after an Agent is disabled or removed. Audits are emitted only for verified pairs that really changed, including successful pairs before a partial-failure response.
- The release workflow builds the Rust CLI for all four target triples, gives every asset a collision-free platform name, imports the Developer ID certificate into an isolated temporary keychain for standalone macOS CLI signing, verifies the signing identity and hardened runtime, requires an explicit `Accepted` notarization status, and refuses to publish a draft missing any CLI or updater artifact. `release:prepare` now keeps Cargo package and lockfile versions aligned with the app version.
- The bundled `manage-skills` skill and both READMEs document the CLI installation paths, state model, safe workflows, and the difference between disabling an Agent, undeploying a skill, and undeploying a preset.

## [1.30.0] - 2026-08-07

### Release Overview
- macOS can now install updates from inside the app, and every platform tells you when a new version exists. Updating stays a decision you make: nothing is ever downloaded or installed on its own.
- The agent list in Settings leads with the agents actually found on your machine instead of a hand-kept "mainstream" list.

### User-facing
- **In-app updates on macOS** — When an update is available, Settings offers **Install Update** instead of only a link to GitHub. This became possible once builds were signed with a Developer ID certificate and notarized, because the replacement bundle now carries a signature macOS keeps trusting. The **Download** link stays alongside it for anyone who prefers installing by hand. Linux still links to the release page: only the AppImage can be replaced in place, and a .deb or .rpm install is indistinguishable from it here.
- **This change first pays off when updating _from_ this release** — Which buttons the update section shows is part of the app you already have installed, so v1.29.0 still sends macOS users to GitHub for this one upgrade. From this release onward, macOS updates happen in place.
- **A new version now announces itself** — The app checks for a newer version shortly after launch and, if one exists, shows a notification and marks Settings in the sidebar. It only tells you; downloading and installing still require your click. There is no automatic app update, and none is planned. (The separate *Skill* Auto-Update setting is unchanged and still governs skills only.)
- **Restarting after an update is your call** — Once an update is installed, a notification offers **Restart Now** and waits. Nothing restarts on its own, so an update can never interrupt what you were doing.
- **Updates work behind a proxy** — The installer now uses the proxy configured in Settings. Previously the version *check* honoured that proxy while the *download* did not, so anyone reaching GitHub through one was told a new version existed and then could not install it.
- **A clear message instead of a failed update** — Updating from inside a mounted .dmg, or from a copy macOS is running in its quarantine sandbox, cannot work: the replaced app is written somewhere that gets discarded. The app now detects this and asks you to move it to Applications first, rather than downloading the update and failing at the end.
- **The agent list groups by what you actually have** — Settings used to split agents into "Built-in" and "More Agents" by a hand-kept list, which had drifted: Pi and WorkBuddy sat up top while OpenHands, Cline, Goose and Continue — each far more widely used — were folded away. The split is now **Detected Agents** (found on this machine) and **Other Supported Agents**, so the top of the list is the agents you can actually sync to, and it stays accurate on its own as you install or remove them.
- **The rest of the list is ordered by how widely used each agent is** — The collapsed section reads as a "what else could I install" list, so it is ranked rather than arbitrary. Your own drag-and-drop ordering still wins wherever you have set one.

### Developer & Governance
- `restart_app` and `quit_app` share `teardown_before_exit`, so the exit-time local backup commit cannot be skipped by restarting instead of quitting — restarting outright would have silently dropped it.
- Restart goes through `AppHandle::request_restart` rather than `restart`. On the main thread the latter spawns the replacement process and exits without emitting `RunEvent::Exit`, and `tauri-plugin-single-instance` removes its socket only on that event. The old process normally exits before the new one can connect, but nothing enforces that ordering, and losing the race means the new instance sees a live singleton and exits — taking the app down instead of restarting it.
- `update_install_blocker` reports only the two states the updater cannot recover from: a Gatekeeper-translocated copy, and an `EROFS` failure when probing the bundle's parent directory. A general writability test was rejected deliberately — a `/Applications` copy owned by another admin account is not writable by this process either, and there the updater's own privileged prompt succeeds.
- The macOS release job now unpacks the `.app.tar.gz` it produced and runs the full signature, hardened-runtime, staple and `spctl` assertions against the extracted bundle. That archive, not the `.app` or the `.dmg`, is what the updater unpacks over a running install, so it is the artifact whose signature decides whether an updated copy still launches. The assertions were factored into a shared shell function rather than duplicated.
- The version check and the updater keep separate sources (GitHub Releases API and `latest.json`). Collapsing them onto the updater's `check()` would mean a missing platform entry or a failed updater request reports "you're on the latest version" and hides the download link too.
- No `tauri-plugin-process` dependency: `AppHandle::restart` is in Tauri core, and the plugin only wraps it for IPC.
- `MAINSTREAM_AGENT_KEYS` is gone. Grouping now reads `ToolInfo.installed`, which the backend already reported, so nobody has to re-curate a membership list as products rise and fall — the previous one had gone stale within days of being edited.
- `DEFAULT_PRIORITY_ORDER` grew from 9 entries to a ranked head of 23, measured 2026-08-07 from GitHub stars for the open-source agents and market position for the closed-source ones. The rationale, the numbers and the caveat that stars overstate general-purpose assistants are recorded next to the list, so the next edit starts from evidence rather than impressions. Existing saved orders still take precedence; this only changes what a user who has never dragged sees.

## [1.29.0] - 2026-08-05

### Release Overview
- macOS builds are now signed with an Apple Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple. Downloading the app and opening it just works — no "unidentified developer" dialog, no trip through System Settings, no Terminal commands.

### User-facing
- **macOS no longer blocks the app on first launch** — Previous builds were ad-hoc signed, which is enough to avoid the "app is damaged" error but not enough for Gatekeeper: every user still had to click through "Apple could not verify … is free of malware" and find **Open Anyway** in System Settings → Privacy & Security. Builds are now signed with a Developer ID Application certificate, submitted to Apple for notarization, and have the resulting ticket stapled to the bundle, which is what lets Gatekeeper approve them silently.
- **One-time keychain re-authorization when you upgrade** — Moving to a Developer ID certificate changes the app's code signature, and macOS ties keychain permissions to that signature. The first launch after upgrading asks again for access to the `skills-manager-git-backup` entry (the GitHub backup token). Choose **Always Allow**; because the signing identity is now stable across releases, later updates should not ask again.
- Releases up to and including v1.28.5 are unaffected and still need the workarounds documented in the README.

### Developer & Governance
- Release builds sign with `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` from repository secrets instead of the hard-coded ad-hoc `-` identity that was introduced to work around #138.
- Notarization authenticates with an App Store Connect API key rather than an Apple ID plus app-specific password. The key is scoped to notarization instead of the whole Apple account, and — unlike app-specific passwords, which Apple revokes automatically whenever the account password changes — it does not silently break the release pipeline later.
- A new pre-build step validates every required macOS secret and fails the job by name if one is missing. Without it a missing secret makes `tauri-action` fall back to a linker-only signature that has no sealed resources and fails `codesign --verify`, which is exactly the #138 failure mode.
- The same step decodes the API key into `$RUNNER_TEMP/private_keys/AuthKey_<KeyID>.p8` (Tauri wants a path, not the key contents), restricts it to mode 600, and rejects a value that does not decode to a PEM private key.
- Signing credentials are exposed as step-level environment variables, so the checkout, Node, Rust toolchain, and cache actions never see them.
- Post-build verification now asserts the signing authority is a Developer ID Application certificate and that the hardened runtime is enabled, then runs `xcrun stapler validate` and `spctl --assess` — the same check macOS performs at first launch.
- Both READMEs describe the notarized behaviour and scope the old Gatekeeper workarounds to the releases that actually need them.

## [1.28.5] - 2026-08-04

### Release Overview
- Update checks no longer hold the skills repository while they talk to the network, so an install, update, or relink started at the same time stops failing with "repository is busy" — and "check all updates" itself got substantially faster. Plus a round of tag-filter fixes for lists that could go silently empty with no way back.

### User-facing
- **"Skills repository is busy" during an update check is fixed** — Checking for updates asks each remote for its newest revision, which can take 30–57 seconds when the query is throttled. That entire round-trip ran while holding the central-repo lock, so anything you started meanwhile — install, update, relink — waited 20 seconds and then failed with `skills repository is busy`. All four check paths (check all, single skill, the tray's "check for updates", and each background auto-update round) now resolve remotes *before* taking the lock, which is then held only for the status write. (#315)
- **"Check all updates" is much faster** — Remotes were queried one at a time, so a single slow remote stalled the whole batch. They are now resolved concurrently (up to 8 at once) and deduplicated per remote: skills installed from different subdirectories of one monorepo cost one query in total instead of one each.
- **Deleting a tag's last skill no longer empties the list for good** — The tag's pill disappeared while its filter stayed active, so the list silently rendered empty with no visible filter left to turn off. Stale filters are now dropped automatically in My Skills, Workspace, and a project's detail page. (#318)
- **The same fix for "Untagged"** — That pill is conditional too, so filtering by Untagged and then deleting every untagged skill hit the identical dead end.
- **My Skills can clear its filters** — It was the only list without a reset control, so any filter combination matching nothing was a dead end. Its empty state now offers "Clear filters" whenever a filter is active.
- **Renaming a tag keeps your filter** — The filter followed the rename, then was dropped a moment later because the tag list refreshes asynchronously.
- **Switching projects no longer shows another project's skills** — A slow skill scan's response could land after you had already moved to a different project, swapping its skills in under the current route.

### Developer & Governance
- The batch update check is now two phases: resolve every distinct remote once — keyed by `(clone_url, branch)`, bounded at 8 concurrent `git ls-remote` calls — off the central-repo lock, then take the lock per skill only to write the status columns. `resolve_remote_revision` is safe to run concurrently: it shells out to `git ls-remote`, and its libgit2 fallback builds a fresh uuid-named bare repo per call.
- Splitting resolve from apply opened a race the merged PR did not cover: a reinstall keeps a skill's row and repoints its source (`update_skill_after_reinstall`), so a revision read from the old remote could be written against the new one. Every prefetched revision now carries the `(clone_url, branch)` it was resolved for, and the apply side re-derives that key from the freshly read record and discards anything that no longer matches.
- `check_skill_update_internal_with_remote` is network-free by contract — a skill with no usable prefetch is deferred to the next round rather than resolved inline, which would have put an `ls-remote` back under the lock at the check-TTL boundary. `check_skill_update_internal` is now `prefetch_skill_remote` plus that apply step, and its contract is that the caller does not hold the lock (only the CLI's `check` uses it).
- `pruneStaleTagFilters` returns the same Set reference when nothing is stale (avoiding a re-render loop), skips pruning while the skill list is empty (an empty list says nothing about which tags are valid), and counts tags carried by a loaded skill as available — which is what closes the rename window. `ProjectDetail`'s skill load gained the request-id guard `WorkspaceView` already used.
- Rust test suite at 401 passing, including new coverage for the prefetch key check, the failed-prefetch status write, and the concurrent resolution contract.

## [1.28.4] - 2026-08-04

### Release Overview
- Interface consistency pass: a skill card now looks and behaves the same on every page, Settings and Backup adopt the shared controls, and a skill with a pending update is no longer indistinguishable from an up-to-date one in multi-select.

### User-facing
- **The skill card is one card again** — My Skills, Workspace, and a project's detail page each drew the same object differently. All of them now share one layout: a fixed leading slot that holds the status dot, the drag handle on hover, or the multi-select checkbox (so the title never shifts), the name, an amber "update" pill when one is pending, and a switch pinned to the top-right. The grid card's floating hover toolbar — which used to cover the skill name — is gone; drag, update, and delete moved into a "…" overflow menu, and deleting now asks for confirmation instead of acting immediately.
- **A pending update stays visible while selecting** — In multi-select, the grid card hid the header update pill *and* suppressed the body badge, so a skill with an update looked exactly like one without. The badge now appears whenever the pill is hidden.
- **A partially enabled skill no longer reads as disabled** — On a project page, a skill whose variants are only partly enabled showed as fully off. Its status dot is now amber for that in-between state, and the whole card no longer dims.
- **Settings matches the rest of the app** — Row headings, help text, spacing, and dividers follow the same scale as every other page. Booleans that take effect immediately (tray icon, Git engine) are switches rather than checkboxes, language is a segmented control, and agent cards put their switch at the right edge and keep equal height whether or not the agent is installed. The redundant "enabled / disabled" pill is gone — the switch already says it; "not installed" stays, since the switch cannot express it.
- **Behavior change: the "default startup preset" setting is removed** — It overrode whichever preset was active on every launch. Startup now simply restores the preset you last had active.
- **Consistent corners across dialogs, sheets, and the sidebar** — Buttons, inputs, and navigation rows inside modals were noticeably squarer than the pages behind them; they now use the same radius scale.

### Developer & Governance
- The card rework introduces `CardActionMenu` (replacing the standalone `DeleteSkillButton`, which routed deletion outside `ConfirmDialog`) and three card tokens — `--color-border-faint`, `--shadow-card`, `--shadow-card-hover`. `ToggleSwitch` gained a `loading` prop so the agent toggle and Backup's auto-backup row keep their in-flight spinner; it replaced the last two private 28×16 switches with hardcoded emerald/zinc colors. An open card menu lifts its wrapper to `z-30`, because the card's hover transform creates a stacking context that would otherwise clip it.
- Settings' local `fieldClass` / `actionButtonClass` / `segmentedButtonClass` constants now compose `.app-input` / `.app-button-secondary` / `.app-segmented-button` instead of redefining them at different sizes and radii.
- Removing the default-startup-preset setting required deleting all three readers, not just the UI row: `ensure_default_startup_scenario` read `default_scenario` on every launch, so dropping only the frontend would have locked users into a preset with no way to change it. The CLI now falls back to the first preset. The stored settings row is left in place as inert data.
- Arbitrary radii across `src/` drop from 101 to 27; the remainder are Agent icon cells (spec'd at `rounded-[4px]`, and three drifted cells are corrected here) and `HelpDialog`'s deliberate `rounded-[28px]`.
- READMEs gained a Trendshift badge.
- Backend Rust suite at 393 passing; frontend `npm run build` clean.
## [1.28.3] - 2026-07-13

### Release Overview
- Windows-focused reliability patch: the app can no longer be bricked at launch by a half-finished central-library move, deeply nested skills install correctly on Windows, and several workspace, backup, and dark-theme fixes land alongside.

### User-facing
- **Windows: the app no longer fails to open after relocating the central library** — After moving the central library to another drive, an incomplete move could leave read-only Git pack files at the destination. The next launch tried to copy over them, hit "access denied (os error 5)", and the app died before any window or log appeared — it just wouldn't open. Migration now only ever moves into an empty destination; if it can't complete, the app keeps running against your existing library at its previous location (nothing is lost) and shows a banner explaining how to finish the move. A failed migration can no longer crash startup (#252).
- **Windows: installing skills with deeply nested paths no longer fails** — The app now declares long-path awareness in its manifest, so installing a skill whose files sit behind a long, deeply nested path no longer fails with "path too long" (works together with Windows' `LongPathsEnabled`) (#298, #299).
- **Sidebar presets reappear immediately after a sync or restore** — After cloning, re-cloning, syncing, connecting to GitHub, or restoring (including first-run restore), the preset list in the sidebar stayed empty until you restarted the app, even though the data had already been restored to the database. It now refreshes in place (#302).
- **Workspace cards count skills installed outside Skills Manager** — An agent's overview card counted only skills from the managed library, so an agent whose skills were installed by other means showed 0. The card now counts each agent's real on-disk skills, matching the per-agent detail badge (#287).
- **Dark-theme agent icons are visible again** — Monochrome-black agent icons (codex, roo_code) were invisible on dark backgrounds; they are now inverted under the dark theme (#279, #304).

### Developer & Governance
- `migrate_repo_if_needed` was rewritten to be infallible — it returns a decision (`Proceed` / `UseSource`) instead of an error, so a migration failure can never panic through the pre-window `.expect` in `run()`. Root cause: the crash only occurred when *overwriting* an existing read-only file, so migration now refuses any non-empty target (never blind-merging older source over newer data) and a fresh target makes the copy structurally incapable of overwriting a read-only pack. On failure it falls back to the intact source via a runtime base-dir override; detailed errors are deferred to `record_startup_error` and flushed once the logger exists (the pre-logger `log::error!` was a no-op); migration is skipped when a CLI base override is active. A grok review pass added two fixes: source/target are compared canonically (`fs::canonicalize`) so a cosmetic path difference — case, `8.3`, or a symlink — isn't taken for a real move and looped forever; and the fallback banner was reworded so it never tells the user to empty the path shown in Settings (which, under the override, is the live library). +6 Rust tests.
- The Windows long-path fix embeds a custom app manifest via `build.rs` (`app_manifest()` replaces Tauri's default, so the Common-Controls v6 dependency is re-declared); it is ignored on non-Windows targets. The workspace/backup/icon fixes (#302, #287, #279/#304) were codex (gpt-5.5) reviewed; follow-ups: conflict-resolution and background auto-backup completion also refresh presets/skills, and overview counts rebuild fresh so a failed scan falls back to the managed library.
- Backend Rust suite at 393 passing; frontend `npm run build` clean.

## [1.28.2] - 2026-07-10

### Release Overview
- Performance and correctness patch: faster startup and snappier actions, installing a specific skill can no longer pull in an entire repository by mistake, and the auto-update settings match the rest of the page.

### User-facing
- **Faster startup and snappier actions** — Launch no longer blocks on a full scan of every agent's skill directories; that reconciliation now runs in the background after the window is up. Project workspace scanning walks each skill's files once instead of twice, and the file watcher no longer fires a redundant full refresh in response to the app's own writes. Addresses the slow-startup / laggy-actions reports (#248).
- **Installing a missing skill errors instead of installing the whole repo** — Asking to install a specific skill whose name doesn't exist in the source (an upstream rename or removal, a stale index, or a typo) previously fell back to copying the entire repository as a single "skill", duplicating every skill it contained. It now fails with a clear "skill not found" error and installs nothing (#278).
- **Auto-update settings use segmented controls** — The "check interval" and "auto-apply" options on the Settings page were plain dropdowns; they now use the same segmented-button controls as the rest of the page (theme, sync mode, tray), so every option is visible at a glance (#241).

### Developer & Governance
- Startup-performance fix (#285) landed after three rounds of codex review: the stranded-target backfill moved off `setup()` into a post-window `spawn_blocking` gated by a candidate-set signature; project/workspace scanning collapsed two full directory walks per skill into one; and a 1.2s monotonic self-write mute window on the file watcher, refined to path-level muting plus a content-hash directory fingerprint so genuine external events are still delivered. +5 Rust tests.
- Install fix (#280) makes `find_skill_dir` bail when a requested `skill_id` matches nothing, preserving the container/root fallback only for the `skill_id == None` enumeration flow; a read-only codex review confirmed no caller regressions, and a follow-up added — then strengthened after a second codex pass — a regression guard for the legitimate root-frontmatter-name match.
- The README Star History chart is now self-hosted (`scripts/gen-star-history.py` plus a bundled font) instead of embedding the third-party image.
- Backend Rust test suite at 387 passing; frontend `npm run build` clean.
## [1.28.1] - 2026-07-05

### Release Overview
- Hardening patch from the first real-world multi-device sync: legacy leftovers from older app versions no longer permanently block merging, sync failures show their actual reason, and the Backup page says "sync" instead of "back up" when remote updates are involved.

### User-facing
- **Legacy leftovers no longer block syncing** — Libraries that were backed up by older app versions could carry invisible remains (skill folders without metadata, half-written temp files committed long ago). The very first real two-device merge hit exactly this and failed permanently with an opaque error. Merging now cleans temp junk out of the merged result automatically and tolerates pre-existing unmanaged folders — they sync along untouched; only inconsistencies a merge itself would introduce still abort.
- **Failure cards show the real reason** — Sync errors previously displayed only the outermost summary ("object merge aborted") while the actual cause stayed hidden; the full error chain now reaches the Backup page, making failures diagnosable without log spelunking.
- **"Sync Now" instead of "Back Up Now"** — With "local changes: 0 · remote updates: 1" the button said "Back Up Now", reading like a push that might overwrite the remote. The pending state now distinguishes its three situations: remote-only updates get their own title ("Updates from your other devices"), an explicit "nothing here is uploaded or overwritten" description, and a "Sync Now" button; mixed states say that syncing merges per skill and neither side overwrites the other.

### Developer & Governance
- Plan-stage input self-heal: residual files inside the managed metadata namespace that the app never writes (`*.tmp.*` atomic-write leftovers, non-JSON strays) are dropped from the merged tree; every commit path also deletes such leftovers from the working tree first — a push-only machine never runs the reconcile cleanup, which is how one got committed in the first place.
- Validator rule 4 gains a grandfather set: skill dirs already unclaimed in either merge input are tolerated (viewpoint-independent: the union of both tips); the merged tree stays strict about orphans a merge would introduce. Input-tip validation (old-client checks) additionally tolerates committed metadata junk via the new `validate_input_tip`.
- `classify_git_chain` preserves the full anyhow error chain (`{:#}`) for all backup command errors.
- A codex review of the incident fixes surfaced two gaps, both fixed: the old-client tip validation still hard-failed on committed temp files, and the legacy-dirt integration test silently lost its "junk already in history" topology because the app's own commit path now cleans temp files — it commits via raw git now and was mutation-verified (disabling the plan-stage drop makes it fail). Backend tests: 377.
## [1.28.0] - 2026-07-04

### Release Overview
- Backup becomes true multi-device sync: changes back up automatically and flow between your devices hands-free, merges understand skills instead of text lines, and a conflict never blocks a sync or overwrites your work — it waits for your decision with a safety snapshot behind every choice.

### User-facing
- **Automatic backup** — A couple of minutes after you stop editing, changes are committed and uploaded in the background; quitting the app saves locally first and the next launch uploads it. A new Backup-page toggle controls it (on by default), and a failed run stays visible as a status card with a plain-language reason instead of a vanishing toast.
- **Hands-free two-way sync** — When another device pushed changes, the background round now merges them in and pushes back automatically — connected devices converge without anyone clicking Sync. Manual "Back Up Now" still works anytime.
- **Skill-aware merging** — Syncs now merge per skill instead of per text line: renaming a skill on one machine combines cleanly with editing its content on another, deletions propagate only when the other side didn't touch the skill, and metadata always moves together with its folder.
- **Conflicts wait for you instead of blocking** — If the same skill was edited on two devices at once, everything else syncs normally; that skill keeps your local version and appears under "Needs attention" on the Backup page and as an amber badge on its Library card. Choose keep mine / use remote / keep both (the remote copy lands as a normal skill named after its device) — a safety snapshot is taken before any choice, so every decision is undoable. While a conflict is open, remote changes to that skill pause automatic sync; everything else keeps flowing.
- **Backups signed by device** — Each device gets a name (editable on the Backup page); backup history and merge summaries show which device made each change, so "yesterday 22:14 · Work Laptop · 3 skills updated" reads like a timeline.
- **Sync races resolved silently** — Backing up while another device pushes at the same moment no longer surfaces as a scary "needs recovery" error: the whole sync runs as one transaction that automatically refetches, re-merges, and retries the upload.
- **Oversized skills stay local** — Skills over 100 MB are excluded from backup by default (kept fully usable on this machine, labeled on the Backup page). Skills already backed up are never silently removed; shrink an excluded skill and it re-enters the backup automatically.
- **Fuller disconnect options** — Alongside "Disconnect this machine", the Backup page now offers "Revoke authorization" (opens the right GitHub page for how you connected, then disconnects locally) and a danger-zone "Delete remote backup" routed through GitHub's own type-the-name confirmation.
- **Reconnect in one click** — When the backup fails because the GitHub authorization was revoked or expired, the status card now offers "Reconnect GitHub" to run the sign-in again in place.
- **Protection against old app versions** — If an older Skills Manager wrote to the same backup, syncing detects it: harmless writes proceed with an upgrade reminder, unsafe line-level merges are blocked with the device named, and repositories never touched by a new version keep the old sync behavior unchanged.

### Developer & Governance
- New `core/merge` engine (merge-engine design v4, four codex design reviews): component-level three-way decisions (content / path / attrs), canonical metadata rebuild for byte-identical convergence (tree-OID-equal merges on both devices), viewpoint-free path-collision reassignment with pending placeholders, and a strict merged-tree validator that aborts with zero changes on any invariant violation.
- Pending conflicts derive from commit trailers (`Skills-Manager-Conflicts` / `Resolved`) so they replicate via push/pull and survive re-clones; hidden refs pin the counterpart version against GC with a staging→promote protocol; a crash-safe apply sequence (pre-merge/applying anchors) plus a startup recovery that settles the working tree and rescues user edits into snapshot tags.
- Protocol markers (`.skills-manager/protocol.json` + commit trailer) ride every app commit, powering two-tier old-client detection with a legacy fallback; the app's own line merges (escape hatch and legacy path) are stamped so other devices don't misattribute them.
- The object merge is the default engine with `merge_engine=system` as the opt-out; the GUI sync and CLI `git pull` share one gated path, and a new one-lock `git_backup_sync` command replaces the frontend commit/pull/push orchestration (push rejections retry fetch+merge up to 3×).
- Two codex code reviews on the implementation (6 + 5 findings): fixed a checkout-rollback crash window, stale conflict pointers after offline re-declarations, UseRemote nested-path data loss, oversized-exclusion gaps in init/restore/shrink paths, and unknown-auth-method revocation; declined findings are documented with rationale (and one pinned by an empirical test).
- Fixed a latent reindex bug: path reassignments between skills (rename chains after merges) could trip the `central_path` UNIQUE constraint mid-loop; rows now park on placeholders first.
- CLI gains `git prune-sync-refs` to clean `refs/skills-manager/*` copies that mirror-style pushes uploaded to the remote; SQLite migration v7 adds the rebuildable `pending_conflicts` projection.
- Backend test suite grows from 304 to 375 (decision matrix, tree-OID convergence, two-repo integration incl. the R3 counterexample, crash-recovery branches, protocol violations, damping, oversized exclusion); README backup section and the in-app help rewritten for the redesigned product.
## [1.27.0] - 2026-07-03

### Release Overview
- Backup redesign Phase 2: connect your backup by signing in with GitHub — no repository setup, no tokens to paste, no git knowledge required.

### User-facing
- **Sign in with GitHub** — The Backup page's new primary connect path: click once, enter an 8-character code in the browser, and the app does the rest — creates a private `skills-manager-backup` repository (name adjustable), stores the sign-in credential in the system keychain, and then either restores your existing backup or pushes the first one. The credential never appears in any file, and the app never sees your GitHub password.
- **Personal access token as the advanced option** — Prefer a token, or need it as a network fallback? An "advanced" toggle in the same panel accepts a PAT with the same automatic repository setup, plus a pre-filled token-creation link. Network errors during sign-in point here explicitly.
- **Public-repository warning** — Repositories the app creates are always private; if you connect a pre-existing PUBLIC repository, a warning now explains what that exposes and how to change the visibility on GitHub.
- **Built-in Git engine (experimental)** — A new Settings toggle routes the backup's HTTPS network operations (fetch, push, clone, remote checks) through the app's built-in Git engine: no system git required, credentials injected in memory from the keychain. Default off; SSH and custom remotes always use system git; switch back anytime.

### Developer & Governance
- New `core/github_api.rs`: minimal GitHub REST client (token validation, find-or-create private repo, device flow start/poll) with stable error markers mapped to plain-language copy; honors the app proxy setting. Both device-flow endpoints verified against the live OAuth client id.
- The OAuth App client id ships in the binary by design (public identifier, device flow enabled); there is deliberately no client secret. On authorization the OAuth token completes the entire connect in the backend — it never reaches the webview.
- New `core/git2_engine.rs`: network-operations-only scope, keychain credentials via the git2 callback (2-attempt cap), errors normalized to system git's vocabulary so the existing UI error mapping and recovery routing work unchanged; push parity (tracking ref + upstream config) covered by local bare-repo roundtrip and non-fast-forward rejection tests.
- Engine preference syncs from settings at every network command entry; a failed built-in-engine clone cleans its partial target so retries don't wedge.
- Windows test fix: platform-correct `file:///C:/...` URLs in the git2 engine tests.

## [1.26.0] - 2026-07-03

### Release Overview
- First installment of the backup redesign (cluster #24 / #264): a dedicated Backup page, restores that are always undoable, and access tokens moved out of files into the OS keychain.

### User-facing
- **New "Backup" page** — A sidebar entry that gathers everything backup-related in one place: connection status, Back Up Now, snapshot history with one-click restore, a clear list of what is and isn't backed up, and Disconnect. The Library toolbar's backup controls collapse into a single status dot that links here; the Git URL field in Settings remains as an advanced entry.
- **Restore is always undoable** — Before restoring any snapshot, the current state (including unsaved edits) is first saved as a visible snapshot of its own and shown in the history; a failed restore rolls back to it automatically. The old "commit or sync before restoring" blocker is gone.
- **Access tokens leave your files** — Tokens embedded in backup URLs (`https://user:token@host/...`) are automatically migrated into the OS keychain (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux Secret Service): `.git/config` and the app database are rewritten to the credential-free URL and the connection is re-verified, with a full rollback if any step fails. Newly saved or cloned URLs are sanitized the same way. Git receives credentials in memory only — tokens no longer appear in any file or log.
- **Disconnect also removes this machine's credential** — Disconnecting deletes the stored keychain credential along with the remote configuration. Remote data and other devices are unaffected.
- **Clearer status language** — The pending state now says how many skills have unbacked changes, and a failed backup stays visible as a red status card with a plain-language reason and a Retry button instead of a vanishing toast.
- **First-launch restore** — On a fresh install with an empty library, the app asks up front: start fresh, or restore from a backup? Pasting the backup repository URL brings everything over (#193/#140 lesson: the restore entry must not be buried in a toolbar).
- **Size warnings** — The Backup page warns when a single skill folder exceeds 100 MB or the whole backup exceeds 1 GB (warn-only for now; oversized skills are still included).

### Developer & Governance
- New `git_credentials` core module: keyring v3 (`apple-native` / `windows-native` / `sync-secret-service` with vendored libdbus), URL userinfo parsing, and a static askpass script that only echoes environment variables — no secrets on disk.
- New commands `git_backup_sanitize_remote_url`, `git_backup_migrate_credentials`, `git_backup_size_report`; `git_backup_set_remote` returns the sanitized URL and `git_backup_restore_version` returns the safety-point tag. App startup runs the credential migration idempotently in the background.
- Backup-redesign Phase 1 acceptance is now automated: #244 (status stays in-sync across a simulated restart), #260 (disconnect clears origin and setting, idempotent), migration rollback leaves no half-migrated state, restore safety point captures dirty edits, and URL credential parsing — 304 tests total.
- `test.yml` gains a Linux cargo-check job so Linux-only compile breaks (e.g. keyring's vendored libdbus) surface on push instead of at release time; previously Linux was only compiled by the release workflow.
- Git error mapping extracted from the Backup page into `lib/gitErrors.ts`, shared with the first-run dialog; backup proposal Phase 1 status updated in `docs/backup-redesign-proposal.md` §7.

## [1.25.2] - 2026-07-03

### Release Overview
- A data-trust patch for the two top-ranked P0 issues: project workspaces finally honor symlink mode, and a broken central-library config no longer silently presents as an empty library.

### User-facing
- **Project workspaces now honor symlink mode** — Installing a skill into a project workspace, or updating it from the center, always copied files no matter what the sync-mode setting said; these paths never requested a symlink, which is why the v1.23.1 Windows junction fix never helped and macOS was affected too. They now follow the sync-mode setting exactly like the global workspace, reusing the same platform fallbacks. Updating also refuses to overwrite a project copy that has unsynced local edits, mirroring the global-workspace protection. Note: project symlinks point at this machine's central library and won't travel with the repo — the sync-mode setting description now says so (#225, #202).
- **A broken central-library config no longer looks like losing every skill** — When `repo-config.json` was unreadable, corrupt, or contained an invalid path, the app silently fell back to the default location and created a fresh empty library there, presenting as "the library was rebuilt, all skills gone" while the data still sat at the configured path. Settings now shows a warning banner explaining the fallback and that the data is still at the previously configured location (#228 follow-up report).
- **Safer install/update guardrails** — The copy-overlap guard now rejects a source that cannot be resolved (missing or dangling symlink) and mutual source/destination containment before any destructive step runs, hardening local-skill updates against data loss (#199 hardening).

### Developer & Governance
- Central-repo config loading now distinguishes missing / valid / invalid states; new `get_central_repo_warnings` command feeds the Settings banner.
- The legacy `.agent-skills` migration ran after directory creation had already made its condition false (dead code since the ordering changed); it now runs first. Also removed a `home_dir().unwrap()` on that path.
- Global local-skill updates (`update_agent_local_skill_from_center`) follow the sync-mode setting as well.
- 7 new unit tests: guard edge cases (missing/dangling source, mutual containment), hashing through a symlinked root, and config three-state loading. Root causes and fix plans were adversarially reviewed (codex, read-only sandbox) before implementation.

## [1.25.1] - 2026-07-03

### Release Overview
- A backup-trust patch: sync status no longer misreports "central is newer" after a restart, and the Git backup remote can now actually be disconnected.

### User-facing
- **Sync status stays consistent across restarts** — Uploading a skill to the central library and restarting the app no longer flips the project-workspace status from "in sync" to "central is newer". Reindexing now preserves a skill's timestamp when its content is unchanged (#244).
- **Disconnect Git backup** — Settings → Git Sync Configuration now has a Disconnect button that removes the remote configuration from this machine; local skills and the remote repository are kept. Previously a cleared remote URL always reappeared on reopen because the UI backfilled it from `.git/config` — the saved setting is now the single source of truth (#260, also resolves the "cannot reset configuration" part of #108).
- **Copy consistency** — Backup-related copy now consistently refers to the "Library" page (previously "My Skills").

### Developer & Governance
- New `git_backup_remove_remote` Tauri command: idempotently removes the git origin and clears the saved remote URL setting, so a retry after a partial disconnect converges.
- Two new unit tests cover the disconnect path (origin removal is idempotent; succeeds on a non-repo directory).

## [1.25.0] - 2026-06-19

### Release Overview
- This release adds global tag rename and delete from the skill filter bar via a right-click context menu.

### User-facing
- **Right-click tag management from the filter bar** — Right-click any tag pill in the filter bar to open a context menu with Rename and Delete options.
- **Rename tags globally** — The Rename action opens a modal dialog, applies the new tag name to all skills, and updates any active filters automatically.
- **Delete tags globally with confirmation** — The Delete action asks for confirmation before removing the tag from all skills.
- **Cleaner filter pills** — The previous hover-icon design (✏️/🗑️ on each pill) has been removed; left-click still filters by tag as before.

### Developer & Governance
- Added `src/components/TagRenameDialog.tsx` for the modal rename dialog.
- The backend `rename_tag` / `delete_tag` SQLite commands were already shipped in v1.24.0; this release wires them into the redesigned filter-bar UX.
- Added `tagName` and `manageHint` i18n keys to English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-06-18

### Release Overview
- A new built-in agent: OMP Agent (oh-my-pi) now ships out of the box, with skills syncing to oh-my-pi's native user- and project-level skill paths.

### User-facing
- **OMP Agent (oh-my-pi) is now a built-in agent** — oh-my-pi ships out of the box with its own icon. User-level skills sync to `~/.omp/agent/skills`, and project-level skills to `<repo>/.omp/skills` — matching oh-my-pi's native skill discovery, whose project-scope path drops the `agent` segment. OMP Agent is listed under the "more agents" section in Settings and sits after the mainstream coding agents in the default agent order (#235).

### Developer & Governance
- Added the `omp_agent` tool adapter with asymmetric default paths (user `~/.omp/agent/skills`, project `<repo>/.omp/skills`) per oh-my-pi's `native` discovery provider; it is placed after `opencode` in `DEFAULT_PRIORITY_ORDER` and excluded from `MAINSTREAM_AGENT_KEYS`. Unit tests cover the adapter's default paths and the new-agent insertion order for existing users.
## [1.23.2] - 2026-06-17

### Release Overview
- A sync-accuracy fix: copy-mode skills that contain Python scripts no longer get falsely flagged "center changed" after their scripts run, because compiled-Python artifacts are now excluded from skill content hashing.

### User-facing
- **Running a skill's Python scripts no longer marks it as out-of-sync** — For skills deployed in copy mode, executing their Python scripts created `__pycache__/*.pyc` bytecode caches inside the agent's copy. Those cache files were folded into the skill's content hash, so the copy diverged from the central library and the skill stayed flagged "center changed" until a manual re-sync. `__pycache__` directories and `*.pyc` files are now excluded from content hashing (and from the source-diff view), so a skill keeps reading as in-sync after its scripts run. Symlink-mode skills were never affected, since the deployed link and the library are the same files.

### Developer & Governance
- `content_hash` now ignores `__pycache__` and `*.pyc` through the shared `list_content_files` enumeration, so the update badge and the source-diff stay consistent; added unit tests covering both a `__pycache__` directory and a loose `.pyc` file.

## [1.23.1] - 2026-06-10

### Release Overview
- A Windows link-mode rescue release: when Windows blocks symlink creation (no admin rights, Developer Mode off), skills now sync as directory junctions instead of silently degrading to full copies. Also adds a CI job that finally runs the Rust test suite on macOS and Windows.

### User-facing
- **Symlink mode now works on Windows without Developer Mode** — Creating real symlinks on Windows requires admin rights or Developer Mode, so for most users the "symlink" sync mode silently fell back to copying every skill into each agent's folder, ballooning disk usage for large skills. When a symlink cannot be created, Skills Manager now creates a directory junction instead — junctions need no privilege on local NTFS volumes and stay live-linked to the central library exactly like symlinks. Full copy remains only as the last resort, e.g. for WSL targets (`\\wsl.localhost\...`), which Windows cannot link to from user mode (#126, #38). Note: targets that already degraded to copies are not converted automatically — trigger a manual re-sync (or update the skill) to switch them to junctions.
- **Dangling directory links are now removed correctly on Windows** — Deleting a synced skill whose directory symlink/junction pointed at an already-removed source used to fail silently and leave a broken link behind; removal now classifies links by their own metadata instead of following them.

### Developer & Governance
- New `Test` CI workflow runs `cargo test` on macOS and Windows for every push/PR touching `src-tauri/`, so `cfg(windows)` code paths (symlink/junction sync, removal) are finally exercised automatically; a `taskkill vctip.exe` step keeps the Windows post-job cache save from flaking.
- Skill content hashes now use `/` path separators on Windows too, so identical skill content hashes identically across platforms; existing Windows hashes recompute once on next sync.
- Fixed the pull-conflict git test to pin the bare remote's initial branch to `main` — CI runners have no global `init.defaultBranch`, which left the cloned repo on an unborn branch and broke the test everywhere except dev machines.
## [1.23.0] - 2026-06-06

### Release Overview
- A release centered on cleaner skill/preset boundaries: installing a skill now only adds it to the central library instead of silently joining the active preset, and preset exports and agent ordering respect which agents are actually enabled. Also adds Grok as a built-in agent.

### User-facing
- **Grok is now a built-in agent** — Grok ships out of the box with skill paths at `~/.grok/skills` and `<repo>/.grok/skills`, slotted right after Codex in the default order and the Settings agent group, with its own icon.
- **Installing a skill no longer auto-adds it to the active preset** — Installs now only add the skill to the central library. Previously each install was silently added to whichever preset was active and synced to your agents; because the active preset drifts (creating a preset auto-activates it, deleting the active one picks a replacement, startup restores the default), skills leaked into unintended presets and had to be removed by hand. To enable an installed skill, add it to a preset (or install it to an agent) explicitly — matching the CLI, which already behaved this way (#213).
- **Preset exports target only enabled agents** — Exporting a preset to a project now writes to agents that are both installed and enabled, instead of also touching disabled ones, so a disabled agent no longer receives preset skills (#206).
- **Newly added agents keep their canonical order** — For users who already have a saved agent order, a newly registered priority agent (such as Grok) is now inserted right after its predecessor in the default order instead of being appended at the bottom.

### Developer & Governance
- All five desktop install paths now pass `None` to `store_installed_skill_unlocked` instead of the active scenario, and the batch-import "already exists" branch no longer re-adds skills to the active preset; the function's `Option` parameter is retained for the CLI's `--sync` / `--sync-preset` (#213, #214).
- Collapsed the duplicated `installed && enabled` agent-filter predicate (`getDefaultExportAgents`, `initialSheetAgents`, `presetBarAgentKeys`) into a single `enabledInstalledAgentKeys()` helper so the availability rule cannot drift between call sites (#206).
- `merge_order` now inserts a new priority agent right after its predecessor in `DEFAULT_PRIORITY_ORDER` (non-priority agents still append), with unit tests for fresh install, new-priority insertion, and non-priority append.
- Added video intro links (YouTube + Bilibili) to the README.
## [1.22.5] - 2026-06-01

### Release Overview
- A Git-sync reliability release: the very first backup to a fresh remote now actually uploads instead of silently reporting "Up to date", conflicting edits from two machines recover gracefully instead of wedging the library, and Git operations are now logged so sync problems can be diagnosed. Built-in agents also gain editable project skill paths.

### User-facing
- **First backup to a new remote now uploads** — Setting up backup against a freshly created empty repository used to commit everything locally but never push, so Sync reported "Up to date" while the remote stayed empty. The first sync now correctly performs the initial push (setting up upstream tracking), so a new remote is populated as expected (#162, #179, #116).
- **Sync conflicts recover instead of breaking the library** — When two machines edited the same skill and both synced, the merge conflict left the repository in a stuck state that blocked all future syncs (and could even prevent the app from loading). Sync now rolls back the failed merge automatically and offers a one-click "re-clone from remote" recovery, with skills that exist only locally preserved (#169).
- **Built-in agents get editable project skill paths** — The per-project skills path (and reset-to-default) that was previously only available for custom agents now works for built-in agents too. Each path row exposes edit/reset actions on hover for both the global and project paths.

### Developer & Governance
- Fixed the sync push gate in `handleGitSync`: a `no_upstream` repo reports `ahead = 0` (there is no `@{upstream}` to diff against), so the old `committed || ahead > 0` condition skipped the first push entirely. It now also pushes when `upstream_health === "no_upstream"`, relying on the backend `push -u` path to establish tracking.
- Added structured logging across the Git backup subsystem (`init`/`set_remote`/`commit`/`push`/`pull`/`snapshot`/`restore`/`clone`/`reclone`) at INFO, with a single WARN failure chokepoint in `run_git_checked`; remote URLs are redacted. Previously the subsystem emitted no logs, leaving "sync silently did nothing" reports undiagnosable.
- `pull_unlocked` now runs the merge via `run_git` and, on conflict, logs a warning, runs best-effort `git merge --abort` to clear the conflicted tree and `MERGE_HEAD`, then bails with a recognizable `SYNC_CONFLICT` error; the frontend routes that to the recovery dialog (re-clone only for conflicts). Regression tests cover first-push-to-empty-remote and the two-sided conflict abort.
- Built-in agent project-path overrides persist in a new `custom_tool_project_paths` setting (an empty value or one equal to the built-in default clears the override); the Settings path UI was unified so global and project rows share the same right-aligned hover actions.
## [1.22.4] - 2026-05-30

### Release Overview
- A fix release that restores the missing delete/manage button after uploading a global-workspace skill to the central library, and makes the "update available" badge agree with what the Diff tab actually shows.

### User-facing
- **Uploaded skills get their delete button back** — Uploading a skill from the Global Workspace to the central library used to leave the card with no actions at all: the skill was synced but unmanaged, so neither a delete nor a re-upload button appeared. Newly uploaded skills are now registered as managed targets, and a one-time startup repair restores the button for skills that were already stranded by the earlier behavior.
- **Update badge and diff now agree** — The "update available" badge hashed the whole skill directory, but the Diff tab only compared the main `SKILL.md`, so a change inside `references/`, `scripts/`, an added/removed file, or an exec-bit flip would flag an update yet show an empty diff. The Diff tab now reports per-file changes across the entire skill directory, so the badge and the diff always match.

### Developer & Governance
- Uploading a local agent skill to the center now reuses the regular `sync_single_skill_to_tool` path so the adopted skill becomes a managed target consistent with every other managed skill; the freshly inserted skill row is rolled back if target registration fails.
- Added a `backfill_stranded_agent_targets` startup repair that scans each installed, enabled agent for center skills whose `source_ref` points at an agent skills dir but lack a target. It matches strictly by `source_ref` (never content hash, to avoid adopting look-alikes) and only repairs skills the workspace classifies as `in_sync` (since the sync rewrites the agent artifact from central). The pass is idempotent and short-circuits on a cheap pre-check once everything is targeted.
- Shared one file-enumeration helper (`content_hash::list_content_files`) for both hashing and diffing so their scope can never drift, and added a `get_skill_source_diff` command returning per-file entries (added / removed / modified; text / binary / too_large / permission_only); the Diff tab renders `SkillSourceDiffViewer` per changed file, lazily loaded on open.
- Documented the macOS 15 Gatekeeper "could not verify this app is free of malware" dialog in the README, with a screenshot and the steps to open the app anyway.
- CI: skip the rust-cache save step to avoid false-positive failures on Windows release builds.
## [1.22.3] - 2026-05-30

### Release Overview
- A small fix release that keeps each project's agent buttons readable in the skill detail panel when a project targets many agents.

### User-facing
- **Agent buttons no longer overflow the card** — In a skill's detail panel, projects that target many agents used to push the per-agent add/installed buttons past the card edge, where they were clipped. The buttons now sit on their own line below the project name and wrap as needed, so both the project name and every agent button stay visible (#188, #189).

### Developer & Governance
- Restructured the project row in `SkillProjectsSection` from a single horizontal flex line to a two-line stack (name + wrapping chip row), dropped the `shrink-0` that prevented `flex-wrap` from triggering, left-aligned the chips under the project name, and cleaned up the leftover indentation in the chip map block.
## [1.22.2] - 2026-05-28

### Release Overview
- A maintenance release that fixes a startup crash and makes skills visible to the Codex CLI again.

### User-facing
- **Codex skills are visible again** — Skills now deploy to `~/.codex/skills/`, which is where the Codex CLI actually reads user-level skills. Earlier builds wrote them to `~/.agents/skills/`, so installed skills never showed up in Codex; that path is kept as a discovery fallback so existing installs still surface in the Codex tab (#182).
- **No more startup crash from stale presets** — Fixed a foreign-key panic that could crash the app on launch when a preset still referenced a skill that had been deleted. Stale memberships are now skipped (and logged) during reindex instead of aborting startup (#170).

### Developer & Governance
- Sync logging is quieter and more useful: dropped the spurious `package-lock` peer-marker noise and now warns when a stale preset membership is skipped, with a regression test covering memberships that point at a missing skill or preset.
- Reworked both CHANGELOG files and the release-notes template around three audience-aware sections (Release Overview / User-facing / Developer & Governance), replacing the old Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed split.
- Release notes are now assembled with auto-injected metadata — release date, the previous-tag→current-tag compare URL, and a verification block — and an awk pass strips any empty section so half-filled entries can't leak placeholder headings.

## [1.22.1] - 2026-05-22

### Release Overview
- This release cleans up two confusing status indicators so the Library cards and Settings agent toggle are readable at a glance.

### User-facing
- **Library card status indicator** — Removed the small circle in the top-left of each Library skill card. It conflated "synced to any agent" with preset membership, which the green left border already shows; per-agent sync status remains in the bottom-right agent dots.
- **Discoverable agent toggle in Settings** — The tiny status icon next to each agent has been replaced with a macOS-style switch (green = enabled, gray = disabled). The previous icon looked like a status badge, so users didn't realize they could click it to enable or disable an agent.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-05-21

### User-facing
- **Skill auto-update** — New **Settings → Skill Auto-Update** section. Pick a background check frequency (hourly / every 6 hours / daily) so the "update available" badge stays current while the app is open, and optionally enable **Apply updates automatically** to pull and apply detected upstream updates without a manual click — off by default; when off, updates are only flagged in the Library. The redundant in-Settings "Check Now" button was removed, since the Library toolbar already has "Check All".
- **Lobster Agents** now form their own group in the sidebar, separate from coding agents.
- Applying a preset from the tray menu is no longer blocked while a skill update check is running.
- **Presets are curation labels** — Adding or removing a skill from a preset no longer immediately changes what is deployed to your agents; deployment happens only when you explicitly apply a preset.

### Developer & governance
- Reworked the preset model around curation-label semantics: membership edits are decoupled from disk sync, with explicit batch apply modes and a workspace-scoped tray apply path.
- The background auto-update scheduler polls every 15 minutes to honor the shortest (hourly) interval and to pick up settings changes promptly.
- Tray preset-apply and update-check use independent locks so the two operations no longer block each other.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- **Add from Library sheet** — In any workspace, click **+ Add Skills** to open a unified picker: search your central library, toggle target agents with always-visible chips (with select-all / clear shortcuts), and batch-add multiple skills in one click.
- **Untagged filter pill** in the Library tag-filter row to quickly surface skills that haven't been tagged yet.
- **Delete from agent cards** — In **Global Workspace**, skills that only live inside an agent's directory (not linked from the central library) can now be deleted right from the card. In **Project Workspaces** the per-card delete button is always visible instead of hover-only.
- **Activity log bundled with Export Logs** — Install / remove / update / sync operations are recorded locally, and **Settings → Export Logs** now packages them together with recent log files into a single zip — much easier to attach when filing an issue.
- **Startup timing diagnostics** added to logs to help track down slow Windows launches (#153).

### Changed
- **Dashboard refocused on library-wide state** — The hero replaces the old "Current Preset: …" framing with total library skills, sync coverage, and the actual count of installed-and-enabled agents. Recent activity now pulls from all managed skills.
- **Faster Copy-mode sync** — Skip the per-file rewrite when the source hash hasn't changed; large libraries (especially on Windows) now resync noticeably faster (#153).

### Fixed
- **Global Workspace agent reload could get stuck** — A stale "loaded agent" reference is now cleared on cleanup so switching agents always re-fetches.
- **Project Workspace skill toggles** behave more reliably after changing the target agent set.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- **`skills-manager-cli` write commands** — the CLI now lets agents fully manage skills: `install` (local path / git URL / `owner/repo[@skill]` shorthand), `update`, `check`, `remove`, `sync`, `search` (skills.sh marketplace, no API key), `adopt` (pull existing skills from agent directories into the central library), and `tag add/remove/list`. Every command supports `--json`; `remove`, `sync`, and `adopt` support `--dry-run`. `remove` always requires `--yes`.
- **`presets add-skill` / `remove-skill` CLI commands** — manage which skills belong to a preset from the command line.
- **`presets deactivate` CLI command** (with `close` / `stop` / `off` / `disable` aliases) — close a preset and tear down its sync targets. When the closed preset is the active one a replacement is applied automatically; when it isn't, the active preset is re-synced so any shared skills keep their sync targets.
- **`manage-skills` skill** (`assets/manage-skills/SKILL.md`) — drop into `~/.claude/skills/` so Claude Code (and other agents) prefers `skills-manager-cli` over installing skills directly into one agent's directory.
- **Cmd/Ctrl+R in the app** — refresh skills, presets, and agent status without restarting (ignored while typing in an input).

### Changed
- **User-facing scenario terminology is now preset terminology** — Tauri commands (`apply_preset_to_default`, etc.), CLI subcommands (`skills-manager-cli presets ...`), CLI JSON fields (`preset_id` / `preset_name`), frontend types, and i18n keys now consistently use `preset`. The CLI keeps `scenarios`, `--scenario`, and `--sync-scenario` as hidden backward-compatible aliases for one release. Internal Rust types, the SQLite schema, and Git Backup metadata still use `scenario` for compatibility.
- **Enable/disable a skill by preset membership** — `presets add-skill` / `presets remove-skill` are now the supported way to include or exclude a skill from sync. The legacy `enabled` flag is no longer consulted when computing what to sync.
- **Sidebar preset selection sticks across external switches** — when the CLI or tray menu switches the active preset, the sidebar only follows if you were already viewing the previous active preset. A preset you're browsing manually is no longer yanked away.

### Deprecated
- **`skills enable` / `skills disable` CLI** — both are now no-ops that print a deprecation notice. Use `presets add-skill` / `presets remove-skill` instead.

### Fixed
- **`presets close <non-active preset>` no longer breaks the active preset's sync** — previously closing a non-active preset removed sync targets for any skill it shared with the active preset; the active preset is now re-synced afterwards.
- **`skills disable` no longer secretly re-enables the skill** — the deprecated command used to flip the legacy `enabled` flag back to `true`, the opposite of what was asked. It now leaves the flag alone.

### Removed
- **SkillsMP AI search** — the third-party `skillsmp.com` integration (API key in Settings, "AI Search" toggle in Install Skills, the `search_skillsmp` Tauri command) has been removed. The free skills.sh marketplace and its keyword search remain. The SkillsMP service was not used by any major agent ecosystem and added a paid third-party dependency without unique value.

## [1.19.3] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Report Issue button (Settings → About)** — one click copies app version, OS, enabled agents, UI language, and a smart excerpt of recent logs to the clipboard, then opens a pre-filled GitHub issue template so you just paste and submit.
- **Export Logs button (Settings → About)** — bundles the most recent log files (with sensitive paths and tokens sanitized) into a zip in your Downloads folder and reveals it in your file manager so you can drag it straight into an issue.
- **Crash banner on next launch** — if the previous session crashed, Settings → About now shows a red banner with a one-click report button so unexpected exits don't go unnoticed.
- **GitHub issue templates** — bug reports and feature requests now have lightweight bilingual templates that guide you to use the buttons above.

### Changed
- **Production builds now write a log file** (Info level, 5 MB × 3 rotation). User home paths, git credentials, tokens, and email addresses are sanitized before anything is exported or copied. Repeated noisy lines are collapsed so important events stay visible.

### Fixed
- **Runaway git-fetch loop that pinned CPU at 100%+ and could freeze the window** — a self-driving fetch loop (refresh → fetch → file-watcher → refresh) has been cut; on some macOS setups this also presented as the skill preview going black and only `⌘Q` being able to close the app (#144, #69, #151, #150).
- **Tray icon visible on Windows / Linux** — the previous all-white tray icon disappeared on light Windows taskbars; non-macOS platforms now use a colored variant while macOS keeps the template-style white icon (#154, #149).



### Fixed
- **Codex skills now use the official `~/.agents/skills` location** — Codex reads user-level skills only from `~/.agents/skills` per its official docs, but skills-manager was deploying to `~/.codex/skills` (which Codex never reads) and not scanning `~/.agents/skills`. Both deployment target and discovery are now corrected; skills already at the old `~/.codex/skills` remain visible for backward compatibility (#143, #147).
- **GitHub Copilot also scans `~/.agents/skills`** — in addition to the existing `~/.copilot/skills` (#147).
- **Real error message on local install failure** — `[object Object]` no longer shows in the toast when an install fails; the actual error is displayed (#101).
- **Description in the central list refreshes when SKILL.md changes** — editing `SKILL.md` externally now updates the displayed description without re-import (#92).
- **No more false "install failed" toast when install actually succeeded** — post-install refresh failures (background scan / state refresh) are now silently logged instead of being surfaced as install errors (#92).
- **Changing the central repository path twice before restart no longer loses data** — the migration source is now tracked even across multiple path changes within one session (#92).
- **Multi-variant skill installs prefer the generic version** — when a repo ships several agent-specific variants (`.cursor/skills/<id>`, `.claude/skills/<id>`, …), the installer now consistently picks `.agents/skills/<id>` instead of an arbitrary one (#103).

## [1.19.1] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **macOS "app is damaged" error on first launch** — Release builds are now ad-hoc signed in CI, so downloading the `.dmg` no longer triggers the Gatekeeper "damaged" warning that forced users to run `xattr -cr` manually (#138).
- **Black screen when opening a skill detail on older macOS** — The skill detail sheet now uses explicit stacking, fixing a regression where the panel rendered as a black overlay on Monterey/older WKWebView versions (#69, #144).
- **Importing skills from nested category folders** — `git` skill import now walks nested category directories instead of only looking at top-level folders, so repos that organize skills under subcategories import correctly (#121).
## [1.19.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Agent-local skills in Global Workspace** — Each agent's page now lists every skill in its global folder, including ones installed outside Skills Manager. Per agent you can upload a local-only skill into your central library, pull library updates down to a local copy, or remove a managed one — with search and tag filtering on the list.

### Changed
- **Install skills straight from the card** — Every skill card now shows an agent icon badge for each enabled agent (replacing the old two-letter labels). Click a badge to install or remove that skill for that agent right from the card; the badge shows live sync state with a spinner while the change is applied.
- **Customizable agent order** — Settings lets you drag to reorder agents within each group (mainstream / more / custom), and that order is used everywhere agents appear — skill card badges, workspace lists, and toggles.
- **Unified skill-card click** — Clicking anywhere on a skill card opens its detail panel in the Library, Global Workspace, and Project Workspace; action buttons no longer also trigger the card click.
- **Help dialog** — Added a "Global Workspace" entry and refreshed the Library and Settings entries to cover the new agent icon badges and agent reordering.

### Fixed
- **OpenCode project skills path** — Project-level skills for OpenCode are now installed to `<project>/.opencode/skills/`, where OpenCode actually reads them, instead of `<project>/.config/opencode/skills/`.
- **Opening an agent in Global Workspace no longer reloads the page several times** — the agent-local skills list is fetched once per agent, and a slow request left over from a previously selected agent can no longer overwrite the current one.
- **CLI hardening** — `skills-manager-cli` now returns JSON error envelopes when `--json` is set (including argument-parse errors), refuses to clone into a non-empty non-git directory, sets a 5-second SQLite busy timeout so running it alongside the desktop app doesn't fail immediately, and handles `PATH` correctly on Windows.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-05-09

### Changed

- **Scenarios renamed to Presets** — "场景 / Scenario" has been renamed to "Preset" throughout the app (UI labels, sidebar, settings, help, and all translations). If you were using scenarios, they are now called Presets and work exactly the same way — no data migration needed.
- **Preset bar replaces the "Apply Preset" modal** — Presets now appear as inline pill tags directly below the search and tag filters in Global Workspace and Project Workspace. Click a pill to instantly activate or deactivate all its skills for the current agent scope. Active presets show ✓; partially installed ones show an installed/total count. No more modal dialog.
- **Global Workspace redesigned** — Each agent now has its own dedicated page accessible from the sidebar. Use the pinned **All Agents** entry to manage skills across every installed agent at once. Tag filters, multi-select, and batch remove are all available per-agent.
- **Sidebar improvements** — The Presets and Project Workspaces sections can be collapsed. Agents in the Global Workspace section support drag-to-reorder.
- **Agent icons added** — Built-in agents now show their own icons across Settings, Global Workspace, project dialogs, and agent toggles, making multi-agent lists easier to scan.
- **More Preset icons** — Presets now offer a broader icon picker, including options for agents, CLI work, data, analytics, research, security, automation, infrastructure, and experiments.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Agent-friendly CLI (`skills-manager-cli`) to operate on the skills repo without opening the desktop app — list, inspect, and export skills; preview and apply scenarios; run git backup commands. Supports `--json` for scripting and `--skills-root` to point at any cloned skills checkout. Install with `npm run cli:install`.

### Fixed
- Git Backup: cloning a remote skills repository on Windows no longer fails — the repo lock has been moved outside the skills directory so the clone target can be empty when needed.
- CLI: `--skills-root` no longer writes `skills-manager.db` and other manager state into the parent directory of the cloned skills repo. Per-checkout state now lives under `~/.skills-manager/external/`, namespaced by the canonical path of the skills root.

## [1.16.1] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- Project pages now feature **Add Skills to Project** as the primary action — a high-contrast button right next to the project title, plus a one-time inline tip showing where to bulk-add by tag.
- The Add Skills dialog calls out tag filtering ("Filter by tag — pick one or more tags to bulk-add related skills") so the batch workflow is discoverable instead of hidden.
- Empty project pages now show a clear **Add Skills from Library** call-to-action so first-time visitors know what to do next.
- Added a new **Recommended Workflows** entry to the Help dialog covering single-agent, multi-project, and multi-machine flows.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- Clicking a scene in the sidebar now only opens it for browsing/editing — it no longer immediately syncs skills to your agents. Use the new **Apply to Default** button at the top of My Skills to sync the viewed scene whenever you're ready. The first time you open a scene after upgrading, an inline tip explains the new flow.

### Added
- Show **Applied** / **Not applied yet** status next to the scene title so it's clear which scene is currently live on disk vs. which one you're editing.
- Warn when no agent is enabled/installed so you can't accidentally trigger an apply with no target.

## [1.15.2] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- Replaced the single-skill delete confirmation modal with an inline popover next to the trash button. Deletions now run in the background with a per-card spinner, so you can keep deleting other skills without waiting for each one to finish.

### Fixed
- Sped up scenario switching, especially for libraries with many skills.

## [1.15.1] - 2026-04-28
